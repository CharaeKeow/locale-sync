# Locale Sync

## What's this?

This is a side project for me to learn and just to keep fire in me when killing boredom during weekend. The idea comes from a pain point (IMO) when managing translations keys for my team's web app, which utilizes Google Sheets for managing the translations flow for developers and translators. This setup works fine for us since it doesn't take a long time to complete. But I do think there should be a better way to do it. Hence here I am, seeing if I can cook up something for the translation workflow

Also I aim to also use this project to experiment and play with new things, like Cursor rules (which I never ever try), SQLite (I do think I wanna try use it here, to store the translations keys and messages. Or I might go Supabase route. Let's see my mood), Drizzle or Prisma, and other stuffs that will surely distract me from completing this project ;p

## Tech Stack

- Next (wanted to play with Tanstack Start, but too lazy to spend time to learn. So Next it is)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

// TODO: Add more thing as I build
